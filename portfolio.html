                    system design and presenting them to clients; introduce students to the skills principles and concepts necessary to 
                    implement solutions; use of a high level programming language to implement algorithms; a late-objects 
                    approach will be adopted to teach programming.

                    solve problems in computing; to develop essential skills to enable the solution of these problems with 
                    the construction of appropriate algorithms and a computer program; introduce principles underlying the 
                    design of a high level programming language (HLPL); gain experience and confidence in the use of a HLPL to 
                    implement algorithms; implement HLPL programs using an appropriate programming language e.g. Java; introduce an 
                    object-oriented language initially 20 Columns images and module information as a non-object language.
