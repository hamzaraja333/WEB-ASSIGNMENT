            </h1>

                The purpose of this site is to tell you about the description of my modules that i have in my year 1 first term.
                How you could contact me using the contact page . Have a little idea of my background by  having a look at my resume . 
                And then there is the site report that tells that how I created the website and all the stuff related to that.

            <h1>2.   DESIGN:</h1>
            <h3>I kept the design very simple and neat just 5 pages in a row having all the HTML and CSS properties in it that are required
                no java script or bootstrap has been used in this web site development process. The colour scheme is almost same in all the pages
                except the colour of the hover effect that is red and the background colour of the columns of the display grid are grey and a
                part from that everything else is the same. Another difference that the pages have is the margin and padding  it is very small 
                but still all pages have its own margin and padding that is different from the other page which varies just from a small px.  </h3>

                    browser there were two portfolio coming on the nav bar so on coming back to the code and analysing it I came to know that here
                    is the mistake on line 12 and 13 that both of them are same and that’s where I changed the portfolio on line 13 to contacts and
                    it became correct.</h3>

                    <h3>This is a code edition I did after a while when I create my contact page what happened was like I did all of my work on  the
                        contact page and all the styling everything was perfect but when I open the contact page on the browser I didn’t had any
                        styling on it at first I didn’t realize that my html page is not connected with my style page I keep on checking the style 
                        that weather the commands I used are correct or not then after  spending a long time on this when I accidently had a look 
                        on the head tag of my html page of the contact that’s when I come to know that I my style sheet is not connected to the 
                        html page.</h3>
